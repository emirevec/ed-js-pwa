## Project Description

This repository serves as the home for the "JavaScript Advanced" and "Progressive web apps" Integrative Project. It's designed to demonstrate the practical application of the concepts and skills learned throughout the courses. The creation of a dynamic JavaScript ecommerce app with PWA features, including service worker and push notifications for seamless user experience.

## Workflow

We follow a development workflow inspired by GitFlow, which provides a structured approach to branch management. While we use GitFlow as a guideline, we also maintain the flexibility to adapt the workflow as needed to fit the requirements of our project.

## Javascript Libraries Used

This project leverages the following JavaScript libraries to enhance its functionality:

- jQuery is employed in this project to streamline client-side scripting and enhance the user interface.
- Handlebars is utilized in this project to efficiently manage and generate HTML content dynamically.

## Progressive Web App Features, ServiceWorker and Push Notifications

This project incorporates Progressive Web App (PWA) functionalities, enhancing the user experience with features such as offline accessibility, app installability, and push notifications.

Users can install this web app on their devices, allowing for a more native app-like experience. The installation prompt is triggered based on specific criteria, making it convenient for users to add the app to their home screens.

A service worker is employed to provide offline functionality and cache resources. This ensures that users can access the app even in the absence of a stable internet connection. The service worker is registered during the initial load of the application.

The project leverages push notifications to engage users with timely updates and alerts. A notification service is integrated, enabling the app to push relevant information to users even when the app is not actively in use.

## Compilation and Compression with Webpack and Babel

Webpack is utilized for the compilation and bundling of the project's assets. It efficiently manages dependencies, optimizes code, and generates bundles that enhance the performance of the web app. The configuration includes settings for development and production environments.

Babel is employed for transpiling modern JavaScript code into a compatible version that can run on various browsers. This ensures cross-browser compatibility and support for older browser versions. Babel presets and plugins are configured to handle the transformation process seamlessly.

## Node.js as runtime environment

We aim to leverage its strengths to enhance the overall performance, development speed, and scalability of our app. 

## Tailwind CSS for Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling, enabling a utility-first approach to building user interfaces. Tailwind provides a comprehensive set of utility classes, making styling more intuitive and efficient while maintaining flexibility in design.
